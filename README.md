# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Satwik (aka seven)

I'm a developer and ML tinkerer who enjoys working on systems that learn from data. Most of my recent work explores forecasting, unsupervised learning, and building efficient models from scratch.

Outside of that, Iâ€™m interested in anything that blends software with scienceâ€”whether thatâ€™s modeling the real world, visualizing it, or optimizing how we interact with it.

ðŸ”§ _Check out my pinned repositories below for some of the things Iâ€™ve built._
