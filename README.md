### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
![Vanilla-2 9s-271px](https://github.com/saatweek/saatweek/blob/main/Vanilla-3.3s-288px.svg)

I'm Satwik! (In case, you couldn't guess from the gif right above :satisfied:)
<br />I'm a Computer Science Student, currently studying in [Institute of Technical Education and Reasearch, Bhubaneswar](https://www.soa.ac.in/iter) (Batch of 2022)
<br />
<br />
I'm passionate about research and teaching, especially in the field of Deep Learning.
<br />Each project therefore, is an attempt to understand and teach my fellow coders about the theory and execution of that particular project.
<br />
<br />As if that wasn't already enough, I also try to maintain a blog, [Algos Expeditus](https://algosexpeditus.blogspot.com/) (where Algos is just short for Algorithms and Expeditus is Latin for Explained.) 
<br />I cover a variety of topics here as well. So be sure to check it out too! 
<br />
<br />
I'm always looking for new opportunities to work on, and learn, and if you (fortunately) think that I could come of any use to you, be sure to hit me up on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saatweek/)
