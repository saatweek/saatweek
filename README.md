![Welcome Image](https://github.com/saatweek/saatweek/blob/main/Vanilla-3.3s-288px.svg)

<br />And ***Thank You*** for visiting my page.
<br />Allow me to introduce myself.
<br /> I'm Satwik
<br /> *(but you can call me Seven)*
<br />I'm a student, currently pursuing MS in Statistics (data science major) from [California State University, East Bay](https://www.csueastbay.edu). I had graduated my Bachelor's with a degree in Computer Science


I'm passionate about research and teaching, especially in the field of Deep Learning.
<br />Each project therefore, is an attempt to understand and teach my fellow coders about the theory and execution of that particular project.
<br />
<br />As if that wasn't already enough, I also try to maintain a blog, [Algos Expeditus](https://saatweek.com) (where Algos is just short for Algorithms and Expeditus is Latin for Explained.) 
<br />I cover a variety of topics here as well. So be sure to check it out too! 
<br />
<br />
I'm always looking for new opportunities to work on, and learn, and if you (fortunately) think that I could come of any use to you, be sure to hit me up on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saatweek/)
